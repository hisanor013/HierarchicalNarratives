# Hierarchical Narrative Analysis
This repository contains the code used in the following two papers:

(1) Riona Matsuoka, Hiroki Matsumoto, Takahiro Yoshida, Tomohiro Watanabe, Ryoma Kondo, Ryohei Hisano, "Hierarchical Narrative Analysis: Unraveling Perceptions of Generative AI," https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11032

(2) Yoshia Abe, Shuhei Matsuo, Ryoma Kondo, Ryohei Hisano, "Leveraging Large Language Models for Institutional Portfolio Management: Persona-Based Ensembles"

Files prefixed with NARRATIVE* correspond to the first paper, while those prefixed with FINANCE* are related to the second paper. If you use any of these files, please ensure to cite the respective papers.

The code is straightforward to use. To replicate the results, simply run the notebooks in sequence (e.g., Step0, Step1, etc.). Additionally, the results generated by GPT-4 are included, so you don't need to interact with ChatGPT directly. In that case, start with the notebooks that do not include "GPT" in their name.
